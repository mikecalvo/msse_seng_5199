Idea 1: keep course the same

Issues:
- Grails becoming irrelevant
- GSP approach to UI waste of time
- Better to have more smaller assignments
- Need to update version numbers at the very least

---

Idea 2: Compare 4 server approaches

Client: AngularJs
Server: compare a few server technologies:
Grails
SpringBoot
RatPack
NodeJS - Express
Issues:
- Too many topics to cover in 14 weeks
- Heavy lift to prepare topics in SpringBoot, RatPack, NodeJS

---

Idea 3: Stick with Grails, remove GSP Part
Advantages:
- Less work for me
- Less content

---
Overall Goals:
Simplify programming assignments
Move to 4 assignments
