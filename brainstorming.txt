Idea 1: keep course the same

Issues:
- Grails becoming irrelevant
- GSP approach to UI waste of time
- Better to have more smaller assignments

Idea 2:

Client: AngularJs
Server: compare a few server technologies:
Grails
SpringBoot
RatPack
NodeJS - Express
Issues:
- Too many topics to cover in 14 weeks
- Heavy lift to prepare topics in SpringBoot, RatPack, NodeJS

Goals:
Simplify programming assignments
Move to 4 assignments
